## additions to the original project

- allow for a second setup of the Joe Freedman cycloid-drawing machine 
[Joe Freedman](http://leafpdx.bigcartel.com/product/cycloid-pro) and available for [purchase at his online store](http://leafpdx.bigcartel.com/product/cycloid-pro).
- allow for a free setup of gears, not bound to rails. This is the kind of setup we aim to produce using magnets as mounting points.
